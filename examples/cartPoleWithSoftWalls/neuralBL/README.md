# Learning Switching Control for the cart-pole with soft wall contact

* The objective of this work is to learn three controllers that stabilize the 
cart-pole bounded by two walls **D** units apart. The contact from the walls create
disturbances that cannot be trivially handled by classic controllers such as LQR. 
The switching controller allows the system to respond differently with the 
discontinuities in the system dynamics.
